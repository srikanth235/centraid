# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Centraid, please report it privately rather than filing a public issue.

- Email: **srikanth@crowdshakti.com**
- Subject line: `[centraid security] <short description>`

Please include:

- The affected component (`apps/desktop`, `apps/mobile`, `packages/design-tokens`, or the build setup).
- Steps to reproduce, including OS and runtime versions.
- The impact you anticipate (e.g., local code execution, exfiltration of stored data, privilege escalation).
- Any suggested mitigations.

You should expect an initial acknowledgement within five business days. Please give a reasonable disclosure window before going public — at minimum until a fix has shipped or a workaround is documented.

## Supported versions

Centraid is pre-1.0 and ships from `main`. Only the latest commit on `main` is supported for security fixes. Older tags are not patched.

## Scope

In scope: code in this repository (`apps/`, `packages/`, CI workflows under `.github/workflows/`).

Out of scope: third-party dependencies (report upstream), generic phishing or social-engineering reports against the maintainer's accounts, denial-of-service against personal infrastructure.

## Threat model: pairing, relay, and gateway (F2)

Honest boundary for the always-on personal gateway. This is not a guarantee of
future features — it is what the product claims **today**. Product decisions
that affect process lifetime: [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md) (H1).

### Trust anchors

| Anchor | What it is | Compromise means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Vault owner / sealing material** | Owner holds vault sealing keys (on-disk `keys/` outside backup) and recovery kit | Attacker can decrypt backups and read vault plaintext offline |
| **Gateway device identity** | `endpoint-key.bin` (iroh) | Attacker can impersonate the gateway on the tunnel plane |
| **Filesystem access to `--data-dir`** | Shell/OS access to the gateway's data directory | The landlord anchor: whoever can read/write `--data-dir` runs the admin CLI (`vault`/`pair`/`devices`/`key`), which operates on those files directly and never over HTTP (issue #505) |
| **Paired device key + trust tier** | Device enrollment in `devices.json` + client private key; the `owner` tier is the per-device, revocable admin capability (issue #505 phase 7 — no shared admin token exists) | Attacker acts as that device within its consent/trust tier until the enrollment is revoked |
| **Pairing ticket secret** | One-time redeem secret (hashed at rest on gateway) | Single enrollment if redeemed before burn/expiry; wrong guess burns ticket |
| **Backup provider credentials** | Object-store grants / API keys | Provider traffic + ability to delete/orphan remote objects — **not** vault plaintext (E2E encrypted) |

There is **no multi-tenant server** and no Centraid-operated cloud that can read vault contents. Hosted storage is ciphertext + metadata shape (see below).

**Credential issuance is pairing-only (issue #505 phase 7).** The retired shared gateway-wide admin token (`token.bin` / `print-token`) is gone: there is no durable bearer any device could hold that grants every vault forever. Admin capability is the per-device, revocable `owner` enrollment trust tier, granted through the same pairing ceremony as every other device — the first device paired from the local console gets `owner`. The device-admin surface enforces that tier: **minting a pairing ticket and revoking another device require `owner`** (an ordinary `full`/`readonly` device is refused `not_owner`), so a compromised `full` device cannot enrol attacker peers or revoke the primary device. A device may always unpair *itself*, and the box's filesystem-anchored CLI (`centraid-gateway devices …`, which operates on `--data-dir` directly, never over HTTP) is the recovery path if the sole owner device is lost. Every issued credential is enrollment-bound and severable by `devices revoke` (which cuts the iroh transport, the web control/app cookies, and any per-device HTTP token in one action).

### Local-socket / loopback boundary

- Desktop and daemon gateways bind **loopback HTTP** with **Bearer** auth for the control plane. The daemon's loopback bearer is an **ephemeral per-boot secret** (issue #505 phase 7) — minted fresh each boot, never written to disk, never printed; it is used only by the in-process iroh endpoint host to forward proved requests to the loopback listener (those forwards also carry the per-boot device proof header, so real per-device identity is what scopes them). The desktop embed uses a per-launch loopback token in the same spirit. Anyone who can inject into the local user session, or read that ephemeral secret out of the process, can call gateway APIs as that gateway — the **OS user boundary** is the primary local boundary.
- The renderer is a **thin client**: Electron IPC is for native operations (keychain, window, lifecycle), not a second authorization system for vault data.
- **OS user boundary** is the primary local boundary. Centraid does not claim protection against malware running as the same user.
- Until detached gateway work (H1–H7) fully lands, quitting the desktop may take the gateway down — availability, not a different trust model.

### Loopback / browser control-plane (Host, CORS, auth placement)

Posture after issue **#504 batch 0** (fixed; do not document the old reflective-CORS hole as current).

| Control | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Host allowlist** | Loopback HTTP rejects requests whose `Host` is outside `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` / IPv6 loopback / configured hostnames **before** auth and handlers (DNS rebinding). |
| **CORS — Bearer** | Authorization is carried in the `Authorization` header (or preflight lists `authorization`). Reflecting Origin with credentials is allowed for Bearer intent because the token is not ambient. `Origin: null` / missing Origin still use `*` (desktop `file://`). |
| **CORS — cookie / PWA** | Credentialed CORS (`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` + reflected Origin) is limited to **session-bound shell origins** (`credentialedCorsOrigins` from control/app sessions). Foreign origins never get reflective credentialed CORS; they may see `*` without credentials so `credentials: 'include'` cannot read the body. |
| **Preflight vs auth** | `OPTIONS` still answers **before** Bearer/cookie auth (browsers omit Authorization on preflight). CORS headers on the preflight already encode the credentialed-vs-not decision; the real request is still auth-gated. |
| **Auth transport** | Desktop/daemon loopback: an ephemeral per-boot/per-launch Bearer (no persisted shared token, issue #505). Remote `direct` tier: per-device HTTP tokens minted by pairing. PWA shell: Origin-bound HttpOnly control cookie + app cookies; `authorizeRequest` enforces origin bind in addition to CORS defense-in-depth. |
| **WS / tunnel** | Device plane auth is enrollment/token based on the tunnel; not cookie ambient. |

**Non-loopback / Docker operators (packaging 5C):**

- Binding `0.0.0.0` (the gateway Docker image default) does **not** open Host or CORS. Loopback Host names remain allowed; any other `Host` clients send must be listed via `--allowed-host <name>` (repeatable) and/or `CENTRAID_ALLOWED_HOSTS=host1,host2`.
- Vault and ledger data live under the process `--data-dir` (image: `/data`). **Bind-mount a host directory or use a named volume** at `/data`. A bare `docker run` without a durable mount loses data when the container is removed — the image `VOLUME` alone is not a backup strategy.
- Image process runs as non-root UID/GID `10001` (`centraid`); ensure the mounted volume is writable by that user.

**Honest not-yet (control plane):**

- Formal third-party review of the PWA cookie + CORS combination.
- Full detached gateway supervision (H2–H7) remains open.
- GHCR publish / multi-arch / signed images (release path).

### Pairing and transport

| Property | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| Pairing | One-time ticket binds a device key to a vault; successful redeem **burns** the ticket; expiry is enforced |
| Transport | Iroh QUIC between capable peers; **browsers are relay-only** (no UDP) via WASM path |
| Relay | Public/default relay infrastructure can observe **that** connections exist and traffic volume; it must not obtain vault sealing keys from the protocol design |
| PWA HTTP fallback | Origin-bound HttpOnly control session; generated apps get **narrower** app sessions and must not reach shell/admin routes |
| Consent | Device replicas and app handlers are **consent-scoped**; compromise of one app grant is not automatically full vault admin |

### What the transport can and cannot do

**Can:** move authorized requests and encrypted blob bytes between paired endpoints; support offline-ish device replicas with intent replay; keep provider-held backup/CAS objects unreadable without owner keys.

**Cannot (and must not be assumed to):** hide traffic metadata from relays or storage providers; protect against a malicious app the owner installed with broad grants; protect against root on the gateway host; provide anonymity.

### Explicitly not yet implemented / incomplete

Treat the following as **open**, not as shipping guarantees:

- Full **detached** gateway supervision and adopt-don't-kill ownership (H2–H7) — policy decided, code may still embed.
- **Platform secure storage** for all mobile secrets (J4 decided; verify before store submission).
- Comprehensive **renderer/GPU crash** isolation on desktop (K12).
- Hard **capability walls** on every client surface (C1) — protocol policy is set; not every feature may be gated yet.
- Extension pairing surface ([#462](https://github.com/srikanth235/centraid/issues/462)) — must follow C1–C3 before ship.
- Formal third-party audit of the pairing/tunnel implementation.

## Centraid Assist OAuth: Model B code courier

Centraid Assist gives desktop/PWA clients paired to a non-public gateway a
working Google OAuth path without turning Centraid's cloud edge into a
credential vault. The complete design and user-facing behavior are in
[docs/oauth-assist.md](docs/oauth-assist.md); incident response is in
[docs/recovery/oauth-assist.md](docs/recovery/oauth-assist.md).

### Trust and custody boundary

| Material | Custodian | Lifetime / storage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OAuth `state` | Gateway | Random, in-memory, single-use, ten-minute TTL |
| PKCE verifier | Gateway | In-memory ceremony only; sent only in gateway→Worker `/exchange` HTTPS body |
| Client-session/device binding | Gateway + initiating client | Ceremony lifetime; prevents a copied authorization URL from planting another account |
| Browser binding | Gateway → scrubbed Worker `/start` fragment → signed HttpOnly cookie | Random, one ceremony, ten-minute TTL; absent from Google's shareable authorization URL |
| Authorization code | Google → Worker → client → gateway → Worker | Short-lived courier material; fragment/in-memory only, never a token |
| Callback receipt | Worker HMAC secret + courier | Two-minute HMAC over code, state, and browser-binding hash; no receipt database |
| Google client secret | Cloudflare Worker secret | Never shipped to client/gateway/repository |
| Access/refresh tokens | Gateway vault | Token response transits Worker process memory; gateway seals before use |
| Imported Google data | User's gateway vault | Never traverses the Assist Worker |

The Worker has no KV, D1, Durable Object, R2, cache, queue, connection table,
or user identity scope. Its only cookie is a signed, HttpOnly, ten-minute
browser-binding envelope containing no OAuth code, token, identity, or
connection record; all state remains in the browser. It requests neither
`openid`, `email`, nor `profile`. Aggregate Analytics Engine metrics contain
route, outcome, status, and count only. Workers Logs, invocation logs, and
automatic traces are disabled because callback query strings contain
code/state and Cloudflare traces retain full URLs; any zone Logpush
configuration must likewise omit or redact query strings, bodies, and headers.

### Data flow and fixed return targets

The client first opens `https://oauth.centraid.dev/start#…`. That page scrubs
its fragment before network I/O, validates the fixed Google authorization URL,
seals the gateway's one-ceremony browser binding into a signed HttpOnly cookie,
then navigates to Google. The binding is deliberately absent from the Google
authorization URL: someone who obtains only that URL cannot produce a callback
accepted for the initiating browser.

Google redirects only to `https://oauth.centraid.dev/callback`. The callback
does **not** exchange the code. It requires the signed binding cookie, then a
gateway-generated `d.`/`w.` state prefix selects exactly one compiled return
target:

- desktop: `centraid://oauth/finish#code=…&state=…&receipt=…`
- PWA: `https://app.centraid.dev/oauth/finish#code=…&state=…&receipt=…`

No query parameter, Origin header, or arbitrary state value can choose a
redirect. The PWA scrubs the fragment synchronously before network work. The
desktop main process accepts only a bounded, exact OAuth finish shape and never
logs the link. The renderer validates it again. The client then calls an
owner-authenticated gateway endpoint using the same per-tab/window session
nonce and enrolled device identity recorded at start.

The gateway validates the live state and client/device binding before consuming
it. It then calls the Worker's `/exchange` with the code, receipt, fixed
redirect, PKCE verifier, and its original browser binding. The Worker validates
the receipt against the exact code/state/browser-binding tuple before any
Google call, attaches the confidential secret, and returns only allowlisted
OAuth token fields. Replays fail on the consumed gateway state; expired/foreign
state fails without a Worker call. A foreign gateway cannot redeem because it
has neither the pending state, verifier, nor browser binding.

### Confused-deputy and availability threat

`/exchange` and `/refresh` are intentionally internet-facing server-to-server
proxies. The Google secret is not exposed—it travels only Worker→Google—but an
attacker can try to make the shared client use it. PKCE and the browser-bound
callback receipt make direct or authorization-URL-only exchange attempts fail
before Google and make successful theft impossible without the gateway-held
verifier. The receipt proves that this Worker recently accepted the exact bound
callback tuple; it does not, by itself, authenticate Google as the HTTP caller.
Google establishes authorization-code validity during the token exchange.
`/refresh` has no preceding callback, so the defended residual risk is fleet
availability/reputation: failing attempts could consume quota or trigger
Google's abuse heuristics.

Required layered controls:

- production hostname only; `workers.dev` and preview URLs disabled;
- zone per-IP rate limits for `/exchange` and `/refresh`;
- Worker per-IP and per-location ceiling bindings;
- WAF managed rules, Bot Fight Mode, TLS-only, HSTS, CSP, no-store, and
  no browser CORS access to token responses;
- strict bounded JSON/body/provider/PKCE/redirect/state/browser-binding/receipt
  validation before Google;
- Worker-side scope allowlisting and an exact comparison with Google's granted
  scope response before any token is returned;
- aggregate failure-ratio, 429, 5xx, and volume alerts;
- `EXCHANGE_ENABLED` kill switch and credential-rotation runbook.

The binding named `GLOBAL_LIMITER` is per Cloudflare location, not a true
fleet-global counter. It is defense in depth, not a substitute for zone rules
and alerts. Turnstile is deliberately absent: these endpoints are gateway
server-to-server calls, not interactive browser forms.

The complete `/start#…` URL is a short-lived ceremony capability. A party that
steals it before the page scrubs the fragment can reproduce the browser
binding. It is therefore never logged, persisted, or placed in a referrer; the
more widely exposed Google authorization URL intentionally omits the binding.

Assist deliberately supports self-hosted gateways without a Centraid cloud
account or per-gateway edge credential. The Worker therefore cannot distinguish
a legitimate new installation from a caller completing a valid consent flow
for that caller's own Google account. It limits such flows to the audited scope
allowlist and exact Google-granted scope set; WAF/rate limits/alerts protect the
shared client's quota and reputation. This is not a claim that `/exchange`
authenticates a Centraid installation, and it does not let a caller obtain
another user's grant.

### Failure posture and non-claims

- Worker outage blocks new Assist exchanges and makes refresh attempts retry
  once then skip the current fire. It does not expose tokens or erase imported
  data. BYO remains available.
- Google `invalid_grant` moves the connection to `needs-auth` with a
  **Reconnect with Centraid Assist** note. Silent refresh is otherwise normal.
- BYO is unchanged and refreshes directly, but its provider callback must be
  browser-reachable; pairing/relay reachability alone is insufficient.
- Assist does not proxy Google API calls, store connection rows in Centraid
  cloud, protect against compromise of the gateway/paired client, or remove
  Google Workspace administrator policy.
- Standard Assist must not be called GA until the production consent/brand and
  sensitive-scope evidence passes. Restricted Gmail/Drive scopes remain
  disabled until restricted-scope verification and CASA evidence pass. The
  executable evidence checklist is
  [docs/release/oauth-assist-google.md](docs/release/oauth-assist-google.md).

## Known metadata exposure to backup providers

Backup objects are end-to-end encrypted (AES-256-GCM, keys never leave the
owner — `packages/backup/FORMAT.md`), so a storage provider reads no vault
content. It does observe **traffic shape**: object counts and sizes always
told a provider roughly how much a vault stores, and the continuous WAL
segment stream (issue #408) sharpens that into **write volume and cadence**
— segment sizes and upload timing correlate with when and how much the
owner writes. This is an accepted trade for continuous, point-in-time
backup; the shipper's tick/threshold knobs are where padding or batching
would land if a deployment needs that correlation blunted.

The snapshot format compresses chunk objects *before* encrypting them
(entropy-gated zstd, issue #405 §1), which introduces a **compressibility
side channel**: because compression happens inside the seal, a chunk object's
ciphertext *length* now reveals how compressible — how redundant — its
plaintext was. Two 16 MiB parts seal to visibly different object sizes if one
is highly repetitive (a text-heavy SQLite base) and the other is high-entropy
(already-compressed media, random blobs). The provider learns nothing about
*what* the bytes are, only a coarse redundancy estimate per object, on top of
the size/cadence it already saw. This is accepted for Centraid's threat model:
a **personal, single-tenant** vault where the owner holds the keys and there is
no cross-tenant secret to sift out via a chosen-plaintext/CRIME-style
adaptive-injection attack (the classic setting where compress-then-encrypt is
dangerous — an attacker mixing controlled and secret data in one compression
context). The gain — materially smaller, cheaper, faster backups of the bulk
data — outweighs a redundancy estimate a provider could largely infer from
raw sizes anyway. The escape hatch is in the format: the per-chunk algorithm-id
byte carries a **stored-raw** encoding (`0x00`), and the keep-if-smaller gate
already selects it for any part compression does not shrink, so incompressible
data is stored verbatim and a deployment that wants to forgo the channel
entirely can force raw storage without a format change.
