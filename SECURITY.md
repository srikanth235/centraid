# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Centraid, please report it privately rather than filing a public issue.

- Email: **srikanth@crowdshakti.com**
- Subject line: `[centraid security] <short description>`

Please include:

- The affected component (`apps/desktop`, `apps/mobile`, `packages/design-tokens`, or the build setup).
- Steps to reproduce, including OS and runtime versions.
- The impact you anticipate (e.g., local code execution, exfiltration of stored data, privilege escalation).
- Any suggested mitigations.

You should expect an initial acknowledgement within five business days. Please give a reasonable disclosure window before going public — at minimum until a fix has shipped or a workaround is documented.

## Supported versions

Centraid is pre-1.0 and ships from `main`. Only the latest commit on `main` is supported for security fixes. Older tags are not patched.

## Scope

In scope: code in this repository (`apps/`, `packages/`, CI workflows under `.github/workflows/`).

Out of scope: third-party dependencies (report upstream), generic phishing or social-engineering reports against the maintainer's accounts, denial-of-service against personal infrastructure.
