# Centraid

**Personal software. Your data. Your apps. Your devices.**

Install an app and a local gateway runs it — on your desktop, browser, and phone — or add an agent that works your data in the background. Every app is a thin projection over one **vault** on your machine — a shared personal ontology where your people, money, documents and plans live once, borrowed through grants you sign. App code is a folder of HTML + JS handlers versioned in a local git store; apps serve from the shipped release and update with it, and are authored by agents (the builder that does that ships hidden for v1).

## Maintainer and support (F4)

Centraid is **solo-maintained**. Coding agents do much of the implementation; review and release confidence are the scarce resources.

| Expectation | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| Issue response | Best-effort; no SLA. Bugs with clear repro and security reports jump the queue. |
| Feature requests | Prefer a focused [proposal](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/proposal.yml); large unsolicited PRs may close. |
| Fastest support | Search [docs](https://centraid.dev/docs/), then file a **bug** with logs from [docs/logs.md](docs/logs.md). Security: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) only. |
| Contributing | [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) — one focused change, linked issue, test evidence. |

## What it does

- **Install apps** — 8 blueprint apps (Docs, Photos, Notes, People, Locker, Tally, Agenda, Tasks). Installing writes a consent row and grants the scopes the app declares — nothing is copied; apps serve from the shipped release, upgrade with it, and uninstall keeps your data.
- **Automate your data** — 16 automation templates (Google/GitHub connectors plus enrichers like photo captioner and document deadlines) that fire on a schedule, webhook, condition, or vault data change. Each is a saved conversation; its handler runs in a worker thread with a curated `ctx` surface (`ctx.vault`, `ctx.agent`, `ctx.fetch`, KV state, run history). Templates still copy into the vault.
- **Ask your vault** — a vault-wide assistant reads across every app through one tool register; each app also answers data questions on its own `/centraid/<id>/_turn` surface.
- **Explore the model** — **Vault Atlas** maps every kind, how kinds relate (a star centered on `core_party`), and a browsable table editor — every write going through the journalled command path.
- **Run it anywhere** — one gateway core, two hosts: embedded in Electron or the standalone `centraid-gateway` daemon. Desktop and the installable web PWA share one React client (the PWA pairs with just a ticket over relay-only Iroh/WASM); mobile is an Expo client with native **Photos, Docs, and Agenda** over a consent-scoped offline replica, and remote apps over the iroh tunnel.
- **Hosted or on-device** — databases, code, and consent stay with your gateway. Keep the vault **On this device**, or connect one storage provider for an encrypted **Hosted** copy where devices upload only framed ciphertext and the gateway verifies what the provider holds; a blank machine plus your recovery kit runs `recover` to bring the vault back, lazily.

```

- **Apps are folders**: `index.html` + `queries/*.js` + `actions/*.js` + `automations/<id>/` + `app.json`. No migrations and no private database — handlers reach the vault through `ctx.vault` under granted scopes (a declared **ext band** inside `vault.db` covers genuinely app-local tables). Code lives in a per-vault git store; drafts are session branches; Publish fast-forwards `main`.
- **One agent tool family** — the vault register: `vault_sql` (read-only SQL over the whole vault), `vault_invoke` (typed commands, including every app's declared handlers), `vault_content` (document text). UI buttons dispatch to the same handlers `vault_invoke` does — one calling convention.
- **Live data, no plumbing**: every action invalidates the tables it touched and pushes SSE on `/centraid/<id>/_changes`; subscribed iframes re-fetch.

## Get started (60 seconds)

Prereqs: [Bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.3, Node ≥ 24 (built-in `node:sqlite`).

```sh
bun install
bun run dev:desktop    # Electron shell with the local gateway embedded
bun run dev:web        # installable browser client; connect it to a gateway
```

Headless / always-on instead:

```sh
bun run build
centraid-gateway serve --data-dir ./gw-data --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765
centraid-gateway print-token --data-dir ./gw-data   # Bearer token for clients
```

For Pi-class always-on hosts, prefer f2fs/btrfs or a USB SSD and mount the data volume with
`noatime`. ext4 does not provide reflink clones on common Pi kernels, so daily recovery bases
fall back to a full database copy; the gateway detects that fallback and logs a storage-wear
warning.

Mobile companion: `bun run dev:mobile` (Expo dev build), then pair it via Settings → Phone on the desktop (one-time QR).

Optional device-local transcription: run an OpenAI-compatible file-ASR service such as whisper.cpp on the desktop and set `CENTRAID_DEVICE_ASR_URL` to its loopback `/v1/audio/transcriptions` endpoint. `CENTRAID_DEVICE_ASR_TOKEN` and `CENTRAID_DEVICE_ASR_MODEL` are optional. Centraid advertises the transcript work capability only while that loopback adapter answers; media and credentials stay in the Electron main process.

The PWA can connect with only a pairing ticket over relay-only Iroh/WASM, so a gateway URL is not required. Direct HTTP remains available as a fallback; in that mode the standalone gateway serves the PWA on a dedicated origin and exchanges the short-lived credential for an Origin-bound HttpOnly session. Generated apps receive separate, single-app sessions and cannot call shell/admin routes on either transport.

Full tour: [Get started](https://centraid.dev/docs/start/) — install → vault → first app → phone → always-on, in one page.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `apps/desktop` | Electron host for the shared React client. Embeds the gateway in-process. |
| `apps/web` | Vite PWA host plus its application-specific Iroh/WASM transport; embeds no gateway. |
| `apps/mobile` | Expo app for iOS / Android / web. Connects to a gateway over HTTP; embeds nothing. |
| `packages/client` | Browser-safe gateway client plus the React shell/UI shared by desktop and web. |
| `packages/gateway` | Host-agnostic gateway: wires everything below against injected paths/secrets. Ships the `centraid-gateway` daemon. |
| `packages/vault` | The personal ontology: `vault.db` + `journal.db` DDL, consent gateway, typed commands, sealed columns, sync/outbox spine. |
| `packages/app-engine` | Runtime engine: handler loader, declared-handler dispatcher, conversation ledger, `/centraid` HTTP surface. |
| `packages/agent-runtime` | Drives one turn through the Agent Client Protocol — the single path for every runner kind, with first-party adapters for CLIs that don't speak ACP ([docs/runners.md](docs/runners.md)); ships the vault-register tools and the `centraid` CLI. |
| `packages/automation` | Manifest schema, fire spine, in-process scheduler, webhook ingress, worker-thread handler runner. |
| `packages/tunnel` | iroh QUIC wire protocol — device tunnel + one-time pairing; the TS reference the Swift/Kotlin mobile ports mirror. |
| `packages/blueprints` | Template gallery: 8 blueprint apps + 16 automation templates, plus blank-app scaffolders. |
| `packages/skills` | Agent grounding: `SKILL.md` units + dynamic renderers (live design tokens, host-tool list). |
| `packages/design-tokens` | Colors, type, spacing, app metadata, icons — shared across desktop and mobile. |
| `packages/tsconfig` | Shared `base` / `electron` / `expo` tsconfigs. |

## Build / check

Turborepo + Bun. **Before every push**, run the early PR gates locally so CI
does not burn minutes on format/lint/type errors:

```sh
bun run check:pr       # REQUIRED before push (mirrors ci.yml early steps)
```

`check:pr` is: `format:check` → `oxlint` → turbo `lint` → `typecheck` →
`lint:types` → `lint:css` → `test:matrix` (the GitHub `static` job). Vitest
alone is not enough — package `typecheck` includes test files and catches TS
errors tests still run under. GitHub `ci` runs `static` and `verify` in
parallel (`verify` = build, native tunnel, data-plane, gateway perf,
coverage), then a thin required `check` aggregator. On **main** only,
`publish-report` deploys the public HTML test-health report:
`https://srikanth235.github.io/centraid/test-report/main/`.

```sh
bun run build          # all apps + packages
bun run test           # per-package vitest (hundreds of test files)
bun run coverage       # repo-wide v8 coverage
bun run typecheck      # turbo typecheck + tests/ tsc (included in check:pr)
bun run check          # format:check + oxlint + turbo lint only
bun run lint:types     # type-aware lint (included in check:pr)
bun run ci             # alias of check:pr
```

Desktop e2e: Playwright tests across 14 scenario sections, driving the real Electron app against a mock gateway — see [apps/desktop/tests/e2e](apps/desktop/tests/e2e/README.md).

Web e2e: `bun run --cwd apps/web build && bun run --cwd apps/web e2e` drives the production PWA against a real gateway and verifies pairing, preview/publish, app execution, and session isolation.

| [Apps](https://centraid.dev/docs/apps/) | The eight blueprints, app anatomy, the install model, attach & link, the agent surface, mobile |
| [Devices](https://centraid.dev/docs/devices/) | Star topology, (gateway, vault) addressing, pairing, iroh, desktop & mobile clients, agent runtimes |
| [Ontology](https://centraid.dev/docs/ontology/) | The full logical model — schemas, entity map, ownership matrix, gateway contract, rules |
