# Issue #1152 — the Android and iOS shells at parity

## Lane B — Android: Money's home drawn as iOS draws it

**What changed** (Android only; no Swift, Rust or proto edits):

- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/screens/money/MoneyGeometry.kt` (new): the pure arithmetic — a bar's height from basis points (clamped to the scale, never shorter than its stub), newest-first month order, the chart's one spoken label, a category line's three figures (a dash where there is no plan), the Needs row's joined amounts.
- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/screens/money/MoneyTable.kt` (new): `MoneyFigureColumns`, `MoneyFigureCard`, `MoneyCategoryHeader`, `MoneyCategoryRow`, `MoneyColumnFigure`, `MoneyNeedsRow`, `FitText` (an amount shrinks before it clips), `MoneyHairline`, `moneyRadius`.
- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/screens/money/MoneyChart.kt` (new): `MoneyCashflowChart` (one semantics node), `MoneyLegend`, `MoneyMonthRow`.
- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/screens/money/MoneyParts.kt`: the hero's sentence shares a baseline with its figure; Planned/Left lay across the page.
- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/screens/money/MoneyScreens.kt`: Spending draws `planned_label`/`spent_label`/`left_label` heads over three-figure lines and In/Out/Net on a plate; Activity's needs row is tappable and sends `category_picked` with `needs_key`; Cashflow draws chart, legend (`in_label`, `out_label`, `partial_label`) and months newest first.
- `mobile/androidApp/src/test/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/screens/money/MoneyGeometryTest.kt` (new): six JVM tests of the above.
- Test tags: `money-category-<id>` kept; `money-needs-category` (iOS's identifier); `money-month-<month>` kept.

**Verification**

- The Android check (`compileDebugKotlin testDebugUnitTest`, through `flock /tmp/centraid-gradle.lock`) → BUILD SUCCESSFUL; 38 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors (32 at base + 6 new).
- `cargo xtask rules` (own `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`) → 15 rules, all `ok` (incl. `native-accessibility`, `first-launch-asks-nothing`).
- `grep -n "planned_label\|left_label\|needs_key\|partial_label\|in_bp\|out_bp" mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin` → all six referenced in code (MoneyScreens.kt, MoneyChart.kt), not only KDoc.

**Unverified**: no device or emulator run; the look (baseline alignment of the hero, bar heights at font scale, `FitText` step sizes, the partial outline at 1.5dp) is by construction, not seen. No Maestro flow selects the new tags yet. The commits for slices 1-2 were not each built alone; the tree was built green at slice 3 and at the final head.

**Falsification**

1. Claim: the bar arithmetic and the newest-first order are pinned by the test, not merely written. Check: temporarily removed the `coerceIn(0, BASIS)` clamp and made `newestFirst` return its input unchanged, ran `MoneyGeometryTest`. Result: red as it should be — `aBarOutsideTheScaleIsClampedAndNeverVanishes` and `theMonthTableRunsNewestFirstAndTheChartIsLeftAlone` failed (2 of 6); change reverted with `git checkout`, tree clean.
2. Claim: the shell scales the chart by Rust's basis points and sends Rust's key, deciding nothing. Check: `grep -n "maxOf\|.max()\|maxBy" MoneyChart.kt MoneyTable.kt` → no hits (the only `maxOf` is the 2dp stub floor in `MoneyGeometry`); the only `category_picked` built from the Needs row takes `activity.needs_key`, no literal. Result: holds.
