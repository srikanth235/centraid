# Issue #1152 — the Android and iOS shells at parity

## Lane A — Android: the first-launch deck, and three fields Android ignored

**What changed**

- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/screens/words/FirstLaunchScreen.kt` — rewritten: the deck of three raised-paper slips from `HomeFirstLaunch.slides` (title, sentence, a picture each: the house of Home's roster, a question and its answer, the `net` rule from the phone to a sealed copy), `next_label` / `skip_label` / `make_label` / `restore_label` as the controls, Next and swipe left/right on the whole band, Skip to the last slip and gone there, reduced motion snaps. Tags are iOS's: `first-launch`, `first-launch-skip`, `first-launch-primary`, `first-launch-secondary`, `first-launch-house|assistant|backup`. `gate.body` is no longer drawn (iOS does not draw it either).
- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/kit/ReducedMotion.kt` — new: the reduced-motion reading that was private to the lightbox, shared.
- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/screens/photos/PhotosLightboxScreen.kt` — uses the shared reading; draws `words.opening` (`small` / `onStageSoft`) in place of `StageSpinner` over an empty stage. `StageSpinner` stays (the fetching line and the editor use it).
- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/screens/PhotoShelfScreen.kt` — `NameSheet` takes `canSubmit` and computes nothing; `RenameSheet` passes its own blank guard (see Rust gap below).
- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/screens/PhotosCollectionsScreen.kt` — the new-album sheet passes `collections.new_album_can_submit`.
- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/screens/HomeScreen.kt` — `SwitcherAction` takes `spoken`; the make row passes `sheet.make_spoken`.
- `docs/decisions.md` — R-1129-18 no longer says Android draws the marks above a sentence.

**Verification**

- `flock /tmp/centraid-gradle.lock ./gradlew --no-daemon -Pkotlin.compiler.execution.strategy=in-process -Pcentraid.android=true :androidApp:compileDebugKotlin :androidApp:testDebugUnitTest` (in `mobile/`) → BUILD SUCCESSFUL; 32 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors.
- `cargo xtask rules` (own `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`) → exit 0, every rule `ok`, incl. `native-accessibility` (231 files) and `first-launch-asks-nothing` (2 files).
- `grep -c "slides\|next_label\|skip_label" FirstLaunchScreen.kt` → 4; `grep -n "words.opening"` in the lightbox → 1 hit; `grep -n "make_spoken"` in `HomeScreen.kt` → 1 code hit (plus the KDoc); `grep -n "isNotBlank" PhotoShelfScreen.kt` → 1 hit, in `RenameSheet` only (no `ready` left in `NameSheet`).
- `first-launch.yaml` read step by step against the deck (no emulator): see the lane report.

**Unverified**: no emulator or Compose UI test ran; the deck's look, gestures and TalkBack order are read, not observed. No Swift touched.

**Rust gap**: `PhotosRenameSheet` and `PhotosPlaceNameSheet` carry no can-save flag, so the shelf and place rename sheets still guard a blank name in the view (as iOS's shelf does).

**Falsification**

1. *The gate types no app-id list and asks for nothing.* Throwaway: appended `private val typed = listOf("agenda", "locker")` to `FirstLaunchScreen.kt` and ran `cargo xtask rules` → `first-launch-asks-nothing` FAILED naming `"agenda"`, so the rule reads this file and the deck's single typed ids (`AppMark(appId = "agenda")`, `"locker"`, as iOS's scenes) are not a list. Reverted; the file is byte-identical to the commit.
2. *The deck's words are Rust's and the flow's strings are on the slips.* Read `crates/screens/src/shell/home.rs` `first_launch()` and `strings/home.rs`: slide 1's title is `first_launch_assistant_title` = "An assistant on this phone", the last primary is `make_label` = "Get started", Skip is `skip_label`; `crates/screens/tests/shell_home.rs` asserts three slides and non-empty next/skip. Result: the strings the flow asserts are carried by the fields the deck draws. Not run on a device.

## Lane D — Android: browse the LAN for gateways (`BrowseGateways`)

**What changed**

- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/session/GatewayBrowse.kt` — new: the browse's pure rules (`claimsGateway`, `spelling`, `txtOf`), the two platform seams (`ServiceFinder`, `AddressResolver`), `GatewayBrowseRun` (one window: resolve what is seen, drop what claims no `gw`, merge one instance across interfaces and answers, end at the clock or on a failed finder) and `OneAtATime` (pre-Android-14 resolves run one at a time).
- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/session/NsdBrowse.kt` — new: `NsdServiceFinder` (`discoverServices`, a `MulticastLock` held from `start` to `stop`) and `NsdAddressResolver` (`registerServiceInfoCallback` from API 34, a serialised `resolveService` below).
- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/session/GatewayBrowsing.kt` — new: the effect's life, one browse per screen instance, a window answered as `GatewaysSighted` every `repeat_ms` under the one effect id.
- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/session/ShellEffects.kt` — performs `browse_gateways`; stops the browses of instances that left `Screens.views`.
- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` — `CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE`.
- `mobile/androidApp/build.gradle.kts`, `mobile/androidApp/gradle.lockfile` — `kotlinx-coroutines-test` on the unit-test classpath (virtual time); two lock entries, written with `--write-locks`.
- `mobile/androidApp/src/test/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/session/GatewayBrowseTest.kt` (17 tests), `GatewayBrowsingTest.kt` (7 tests) — new.
- `mobile/README.md` (two "does not browse yet" sentences, the Android file list, the hand-off row), `docs/release/v1-handoffs.md` (row 8.7), `SECURITY.md`, `docs/gateway.md`, `docs/recovery/pairing.md`, `docs/decisions.md` (the Q-1080-D3 row) — "Android does not browse yet" rewritten to current state.

**Verification**

- `flock /tmp/centraid-gradle.lock ./gradlew --no-daemon -Pkotlin.compiler.execution.strategy=in-process -Pcentraid.android=true :androidApp:compileDebugKotlin :androidApp:testDebugUnitTest` (in `mobile/`) → BUILD SUCCESSFUL; 56 tests, 0 failures (32 at base, 17 `GatewayBrowseTest`, 7 `GatewayBrowsingTest`).
- `cargo xtask rules` (own `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`) → exit 0, 15 rules `ok`, incl. `no-listening-socket` (816 files), `native-accessibility` (236) and `first-launch-asks-nothing`.
- `cargo xtask doc-links` → 0 findings over 111 files.
- `grep -rn "browse_gateways\|gateways_sighted" mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin` → 3 code hits; `grep -c CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE` in the manifest → one line; `grep "does not browse yet" mobile/README.md` → nothing.

**Unverified**: `NsdManager` on a device or emulator (the discovery, the resolve on API 33 and 34, the multicast lock, the listener's behaviour when a stop races its start) — the real-network check is row 8.7 of the hand-offs. The `ShellEffects` wiring (the views collector, the `instance !in views` guard) is read, not run: `GatewayBrowsingTest` proves `retain` ends a closed screen's browse, nothing runs `ShellEffects`. No Swift touched; the pure `FoundService`-with-handle design differs from iOS's only where the platform forces it (below).

**Differences from iOS, forced by the platform**: a discovered `NsdServiceInfo` carries no TXT record, so Android resolves first and drops a result with no `gw` afterwards (iOS drops it before it connects). There is no host-is-a-name case (`NsdServiceInfo` gives literals), so iOS's `testANameIsNeverAnAddress` becomes the port-bound test. A screen's close is not signalled to the shell on Android as it is on iOS (`ScreenUpdate.closed` is consumed inside `Screens.apply`); it is read off `Screens.views`.

**Falsification**

1. *A result whose TXT carries no `gw` is never reported.* Throwaway: `claimsGateway` made `true` → `onlyARecordWithAGatewayIdIsWorthReporting` and `aResultWithNoGatewayIdIsNeverReported` failed; reverted.
2. *A closed screen's browse ends, and only its.* Throwaway: `GatewayBrowsing.retain`'s `closed.forEach(::stop)` commented out → `aClosedScreenEndsItsBrowseAndOnlyItsBrowse` failed (3 failures of 56 in all); reverted, 56 green.
