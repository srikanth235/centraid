# Issue #1152 — the Android and iOS shells at parity

## Lane A — Android: the first-launch deck, and three fields Android ignored

**What changed**

- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/screens/words/FirstLaunchScreen.kt` — rewritten: the deck of three raised-paper slips from `HomeFirstLaunch.slides` (title, sentence, a picture each: the house of Home's roster, a question and its answer, the `net` rule from the phone to a sealed copy), `next_label` / `skip_label` / `make_label` / `restore_label` as the controls, Next and swipe left/right on the whole band, Skip to the last slip and gone there, reduced motion snaps. Tags are iOS's: `first-launch`, `first-launch-skip`, `first-launch-primary`, `first-launch-secondary`, `first-launch-house|assistant|backup`. `gate.body` is no longer drawn (iOS does not draw it either).
- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/kit/ReducedMotion.kt` — new: the reduced-motion reading that was private to the lightbox, shared.
- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/screens/photos/PhotosLightboxScreen.kt` — uses the shared reading; draws `words.opening` (`small` / `onStageSoft`) in place of `StageSpinner` over an empty stage. `StageSpinner` stays (the fetching line and the editor use it).
- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/screens/PhotoShelfScreen.kt` — `NameSheet` takes `canSubmit` and computes nothing; `RenameSheet` passes its own blank guard (see Rust gap below).
- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/screens/PhotosCollectionsScreen.kt` — the new-album sheet passes `collections.new_album_can_submit`.
- `mobile/androidApp/src/main/kotlin/dev/centraid/android/screens/HomeScreen.kt` — `SwitcherAction` takes `spoken`; the make row passes `sheet.make_spoken`.
- `docs/decisions.md` — R-1129-18 no longer says Android draws the marks above a sentence.

**Verification**

- `flock /tmp/centraid-gradle.lock ./gradlew --no-daemon -Pkotlin.compiler.execution.strategy=in-process -Pcentraid.android=true :androidApp:compileDebugKotlin :androidApp:testDebugUnitTest` (in `mobile/`) → BUILD SUCCESSFUL; 32 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors.
- `cargo xtask rules` (own `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`) → exit 0, every rule `ok`, incl. `native-accessibility` (231 files) and `first-launch-asks-nothing` (2 files).
- `grep -c "slides\|next_label\|skip_label" FirstLaunchScreen.kt` → 4; `grep -n "words.opening"` in the lightbox → 1 hit; `grep -n "make_spoken"` in `HomeScreen.kt` → 1 code hit (plus the KDoc); `grep -n "isNotBlank" PhotoShelfScreen.kt` → 1 hit, in `RenameSheet` only (no `ready` left in `NameSheet`).
- `first-launch.yaml` read step by step against the deck (no emulator): see the lane report.

**Unverified**: no emulator or Compose UI test ran; the deck's look, gestures and TalkBack order are read, not observed. No Swift touched.

**Rust gap**: `PhotosRenameSheet` and `PhotosPlaceNameSheet` carry no can-save flag, so the shelf and place rename sheets still guard a blank name in the view (as iOS's shelf does).

**Falsification**

1. *The gate types no app-id list and asks for nothing.* Throwaway: appended `private val typed = listOf("agenda", "locker")` to `FirstLaunchScreen.kt` and ran `cargo xtask rules` → `first-launch-asks-nothing` FAILED naming `"agenda"`, so the rule reads this file and the deck's single typed ids (`AppMark(appId = "agenda")`, `"locker"`, as iOS's scenes) are not a list. Reverted; the file is byte-identical to the commit.
2. *The deck's words are Rust's and the flow's strings are on the slips.* Read `crates/screens/src/shell/home.rs` `first_launch()` and `strings/home.rs`: slide 1's title is `first_launch_assistant_title` = "An assistant on this phone", the last primary is `make_label` = "Get started", Skip is `skip_label`; `crates/screens/tests/shell_home.rs` asserts three slides and non-empty next/skip. Result: the strings the flow asserts are carried by the fields the deck draws. Not run on a device.
